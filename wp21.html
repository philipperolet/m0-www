		    <h4>Plot</h4>

	    <p>"War and Peace in the 21st Century" is a short novel about war, peace, and artificial intelligence. It takes place in Paris in a fictional near future beginning in December 2025. It relates how a major geopolitical incident in Asia was unexpectedly predicted by an AI. Jean-NoÃ«l, Minister of New Technologies in the French government, tries to make use of the AI to help the French president solve the situation. This book is the first part of the two-part novel.</p>
	    <h4>A new kind of novel</h4>
   <p>This novel is one of the first of its kind: it was almost entirely generated by a machine. </p>
<p>If you're looking to read a great short fiction, a masterpiece from a talented author... frankly, this book is not the best bet.</p>
<p>But if you're looking to discover a new, fledgling and fascinating writing style, the writing style of Artificial Intelligences, dig in. </p>
<p>First, read the foreword to understand what you're getting into. Then, see for yourself what AIs can write well and what they struggle with, check out the making-of explaining how the book was generated, but mostly, have fun reading the story!</p>
   <h4>About the Author</h4>
	    <p>Philippe Rolet is a researcher in Artificial Intelligence, an entrepreneur and a software engineer. He obtained a Ph.D. in Machine Learning in 2010. In 2014, he cofounded Artefact, a Data and AI consulting company, which he co-led as CTO until 2020. In 2021, he founded Machine Zero, a company focused on exploring algorithms that make machines intelligent and ways to use them.</p>
	    <p>GPT3, a 175 billion parameters large language model from the company OpenAI, was heavily used to create this novel</p>
