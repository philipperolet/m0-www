	    <h2><a href="https://game.machine-zero.com" target="_blank">The Rabbit Game</a></h2>
	    Discover various kinds of artificial intelligence algorithms by watching them play a simple game: a rabbit eating strawberries in a maze (humans can play too ðŸ˜‰). Play it <a href="https://game.machine-zero.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
   <h3>What should I do in this game?</h3>
   <p>The goal of The Rabbit Game is to demystify artificial intelligence
   a little, by watching how machines play the game. But first, you
   can play it a little yourself to see how it works, get a good score
   and try all the various levels.</p>
   <p>Then, you can let artificial intelligences play. Check out the
    8 different artificial players; each has its own style determined
    by its stats--its strong and weak points (in the game, click on a stat to see
    what it means)</p>
   <p>Have different AIs play on different levels. Each new level
   introduces something new that will make it tougher for AIs. See
   which ones get far, which one fail, and why they behave like
   this (in the game, click on "Learn more about me" to understand an AI's
   behaviour).</p>
   <p>Additionnally, if you're a hacker, you can try to code an
    algorithm to go to the highest possible level. If it clears the
    last level, which is quite hard, you can win *a lot* of internet
    points (really awful lot).</p>
   <h3>What is the game really about?</h3>
   <h4> &#128161; Demystifying Artificial Intelligence</h4>
   <p>Artificial intelligence can mean a lot of different
   things. Sometimes it just means a regular program that does
   something humans used to do. Sometimes it means a program that is
   resilient to errors. Sometimes it means a program that learns on
   its own how to perform certain tasks. Sometimes it's just used to
   trigger various emotions in news headlines and doesn't really mean
   anything.</p>
   <p>The rabbit game helps seeing what various AIs are and how they
   work in a concrete way. It shows how each way of making intelligent
   machines has benefits and drawbacks</p>
   <p>It helps realize that AI is not a homogenous topic but that it
   refers to a lot of diverse technologies with each their
   tradeoffs, and that in fact, they are all still quite dumb
   compared to us--yet :).</p>
   <h4>&#128048; Cute for humans, tough for AIs</h4>
   <p>It's cute for humans in the sense that it's not hard to
   understand. It's more of a kid's game, adults will understand the
   various levels easily (which does not mean that they'll be able to
   get a good score).</p>
   <p>What is interesting is to see what's hard or easy for
   different kind of machines. It's tough for AIs because contrary to
     us they don't easily understand and adapt to new rules, and the game has new rules at each levels</p>
   <h4>&#x1f4dc; The story behind the game</h4>
	    <p>This game was initially developed to tell my friends in a fun way that we were expecting a child (born on 2020/11/11), thus all the references to strawberries, unpasteurized cheese and alcohol avoidance. </p>
<p>It was also a way to learn about Clojure (& Clojurescript), a great functionnal programming language</p>
<p>Then, the idea that it could be used as a simple (at first) environment for training AI agents to become more and more clever came to mind.</p>

   <h4>&#128300; AI reasearch: finding challenges simple to express but hard to solve"</h4>
   <p>An issue in AI research IMHO is the fact that "intelligence"
   is not well defined--therefore it is harder to reason about it and
   to find new ways for machines to be more intelligent.</p>
   <p>Being able to express various traits of intelligence as game
   levels in this simple setting would help thinking about new
   algorithms</p>
   <p>To be fair, the first levels are actually easy even for
   AIs. But the last levels aim at being hard for them. Even though
   very powerful AIs developped recently in research labs would
   probably clear them without trouble, such AIs are complex and
   require a lot of setup, tuning and computing power.</p>
	    <p>The underlying goal is to explore the idea that if a task is
   simple to us, there may exists algorithms that can also handle it
     easily and that we can try to discover.</p>
	    <p>The Rabbit Game can be used in that respect, by making sophisticated mazes where finding the fruits is difficult, or by adding rules simple to humans but hard to machines, that require some form of transfer learning, symbolic reasoning, or abstract thought--lever that can make fruits appear in certain conditions, ability to destroy wall by performing specific move sequences, etc.<p>
	      <p>These are appropriate properties to research artificial agents learning abstractions, high level reasoning, complex planning & decision making, etc., especially to observe how they behave.</p>
	    <p>In other simple games that have a narrow environment (e.g. cartpole), or in games that are already complex (e.g. modern videogames), it is tough to create new interesting rules for training agents.</p>
